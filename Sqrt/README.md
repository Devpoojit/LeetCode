#   [Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

-   ### Problem Statement:
    Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

    You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

    For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

-   ### Test Cases:
    -   Case 1:
        Input: x = 4
        Output: 2

    -   Case 2:
        Input: x = 8
